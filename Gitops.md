- Practically the kube repo
- Files state how the infra should look like (4 replicas of webxp-api in exp instance) and the tooling of the repo deploys the changes
- Benefits:
	- Auditability: everything is in the history
	- Security: everything needs approve, as it goes through Git
	- Consistency: all envs synced from the same repo
	- Ez rollback
