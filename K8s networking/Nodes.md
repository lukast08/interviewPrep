- Node is a single machine inside a cluster
- All K8s nodes run in a single cluster
- Each node runs:
	- Kubelet: agent that talks to the control plane
	- Container Runtime: containerd, etc.
	- Kube proxy: Handles networking
- Node can be either a worker node or control plane node
- All nodes share the same etcd and cluster configuration
## Control Plane Node
- **Brain of the Kubernetes cluster**. It manages **what runs where**, maintains the desired state, and coordinates all the clusterâ€™s activities.
- Handles kubectl commands
- Schedules pods
- Maintains desired state (what should be running)
- Watches for changes and failures and reacts
- Talks to the worker nodes via the kubelet agent on each node
