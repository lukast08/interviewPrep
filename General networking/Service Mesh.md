- Solution for managing communication between microservices **securely**
- Provides features such as:
	- Traffic spliting, routing, balancing
	- Observability
	- **Security**
	- Reliability (retries, timeouts, circuit breakers)
	- **Instead of the service worrying about these features, service mesh abstracts them into the platform**

- Without SM, there is usually security before the cluster (like a firewall) but once request is inside the cluster, the components communicate through HTTP. Service mesh adds the security

## Architecture

### Control plane
- Manages and configures the data plane
- Handles service discovery, configuration updates, certificate distribution, etc.
### Data plane
- One for each pod
- Actually handles traffic
- Consists of sidecar containers - proxies (envoy-proxy ve webxp-api)
- These proxy sidecars intercept all incoming traffic for the pod using `iptable` redurection

## ðŸ”„ How It Works (Simplified Flow)

1. **Pod A wants to call Pod B.**
2. The request from Pod A is intercepted by its local sidecar.
3. The sidecar checks routing rules and security policies.
4. It forwards the request to Pod Bâ€™s sidecar.
5. Pod Bâ€™s sidecar forwards the request to the actual Pod B application.

Throughout this flow, the service mesh can:
- **Encrypt** the communication (mTLS).
- **Collect telemetry** data.
- **Retry** failed requests or **shift traffic** based on version.


**Control plane** often implemented through [[Istio]], **data plane** often uses [[Envoy Proxy]]
