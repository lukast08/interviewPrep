- Can enhance/extend the functionality of the main container in a pod
- Shares the same network, localhost, volumes etc. as the main container
- Managed together with the main container
- Common use case is to use a sidecar container to add features to the main app without any changes
- **Is heavily modular and reusable**: same sidecar can be reused across many apps
- Crucial in **service meshes** like **Istio**, where an Envoy proxy handles all incoming/outgoing traffic.
